# Advanced Options
## Dynamic color (Dark Reader)
Enabling this option will use Dark Reader's dynamic color-calculation for the highlight color when Dark Reader is enabled. The color will be based on the color selected in Custom-Highlight but slightly altered to better compliment the dark background.
## Aggressive overwrite
Enabling this option will use `!important` rule to the CSS injects. This might help with websites where the highlight color is not set corectly. It's not recommended to enable this unless you have any problems as it might cause compatibility issues with other stylesheets.
